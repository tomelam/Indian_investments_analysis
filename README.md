# A program to fetch a set of NAVs for some Indian mutual fund schemes, normalize them, and plot them.

A scheme number can be obtained by typing some part of the mutual fund name into the textbox at
https://www.mfapi.in/ . Sometimes it seems a scheme's number can only be found be searching
https://api.mfapi.in/mf .

This project is a work in progress. See CHANGELOG.

See the ChatGPT conversation that helped write the initial code:
