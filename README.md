# A program to fetch a set of NAVs for some Indian mutual fund schemes, normalize them, and plot them.

A scheme number can be obtained by typing some part of the mutual fund name into the textbox at
https://www.mfapi.in/ . Sometimes it seems a scheme's number can only be found be searching
https://api.mfapi.in/mf .

This project is a work in progress. See CHANGELOG.

See the ChatGPT conversation that helped write the initial code:
[Fund NAV Data Plot](https://chat.openai.com/share/9849382e-0b4a-4051-9e40-03214602d751)
I could not share the other ChatGPT conversation that helped me write later versions of the program.
(When I tried to share it, I got the error message "Sharing conversations with images is not yet supported".)
However, I have tried to reconstruct the conversation in Markdown format as the file `ChatGPT.md`.
I have rendered it as a web page, `ChatGPT.html`.
I probably made some formatting mistakes in reconstructing the conversation because I did not scope the job
before beginning it, and I didn't automate it.
